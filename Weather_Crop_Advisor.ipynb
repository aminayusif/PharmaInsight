        "Agricultural productivity is highly influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, soil properties, and humidity. Farmers, especially in developing regions, often face challenges in selecting the most suitable crops for planting due to unpredictable weather patterns and limited access to expert guidance. This can lead to poor yields, wasted resources, and economic losses.\n",

        "The **Weather-Based Crop Advisor** project aims to support farmers in making informed decisions by using machine learning to recommend the best crops to plant based on prevailing agro-meteorological and soil conditions. By analyzing features like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil pH, the system learns patterns from historical data to predict the most suitable crops for a given set of conditions.\n",
